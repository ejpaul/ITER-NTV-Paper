  abstract={Two approaches are examined for stabilization of the resistive wall mode (RWM) of toroidal mode number n = 1 in an advanced ITER scenario. Active feedback control, with the present coil design and poloidal sensors placed just inside the inner wall, can be very efficient in stabilizing the RWM. Within the voltage limit of the present design for the feedback coils and conservative constraints on performance, the plasma pressure can be increased up to at least 70% between the no-wall and ideal-wall beta limits. Stabilization of the RWM by toroidal plasma rotation depends on the rotation profile as well as on the model for ion Landau damping. Feedback control of rotating plasmas for the advanced scenario is considered. The effect of the blanket is also studied using a simplified model.}

abstract = {By using a fully three dimensional magnetic field orbit-following Monte-Carlo code, the energetic ion confinement was investigated for the current conceptual design of the ferromagnetic components in ITER which will be employed for reducing the toroidal magnetic field (TF) ripple. The ferromagnetic insert is effective in the reference standard scenario with Q = 10 (Scenario No. 2) and steady state scenario with Q = 5 (Scenario No. 4) to improve the energetic ion confinement. Over-compensation appears at half of the full toroidal magnetic field and its effect becomes stronger when the quantity of the ferromagnetic insert is increased in order to more reduce the TF ripple at the full toroidal magnetic field. Though the current design is acceptable, whether to increase the ferromagnetic insert to achieve lower TF ripple amplitude at the full field operation depends on how prospected are possibilities of lower field operations. Planned test blanket modules do not induce large loss ({\textless}1{\%}) at the full field in Scenario No. 4. At the half field, however, the loss reaches ???10{\%} for the alpha particles due to localized large TF ripple. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Up to six different concepts for tritium breeding blanket systems, referred to as Test Blanket Systems (TBS), will be tested in three equatorial ports of ITER. Successful TBS experiments in ITER represent an essential step on the path to DEMO for all the ITER Members' fusion development plans. The ITER Members are in charge of the design, manufacturing and delivery of the TBSs to the ITER site. The IO has responsibility for preparing the necessary interfaces required for the installation of the TBSs. Moreover, the TBM Program has to be fully integrated in the ITER Research Plan and its testing objectives have to be synchronized with the planned ITER operations. The paper addresses the major implementation steps of the TBM Program in ITER, including the organizational aspects, its integration into the ITER Research Plan and the Operational Plan, the licensing procedure and also gives a short overview of the TBS/ITER interfaces issues. ?? 2010 V.A.

@article{Schaffer2011,
abstract = {Experiments at DIII-D investigated the effects of magnetic error fields similar to those expected from proposed ITER test blanket modules (TBMs) containing ferromagnetic material. Studied were effects on: plasma rotation and locking, confinement, L–H transition, the H-mode pedestal, edge localized modes (ELMs) and ELM suppression by resonant magnetic perturbations, energetic particle losses, and more. The experiments used a purpose-built three-coil mock-up of two magnetized ITER TBMs in one ITER equatorial port. The largest effect was a reduction in plasma toroidal rotation velocity v across the entire radial profile by as much as $\Delta$v/v {\~{}} 60{\%} via non-resonant braking. Changes to global $\Delta$n/n, $\Delta$$\beta$/$\beta$ and $\Delta$H98/H98 were {\~{}}3 times smaller. These effects are stronger at higher $\beta$. Other effects were smaller. The TBM field increased sensitivity to locking by an applied known n = 1 test field in both L- and H-mode plasmas. Locked mode tolerance was completely restored in L-mode by re-adjusting the DIII-D n = 1 error field compensation system. Numerical modelling by IPEC reproduces the rotation braking and locking semi-quantitatively, and identifies plasma amplification of a few n = 1 Fourier harmonics as the main cause of braking. IPEC predicts that TBM braking in H-mode may be reduced by n = 1 control. Although extrapolation from DIII-D to ITER is still an open issue, these experiments suggest that a TBM-like error field will produce only a few potentially troublesome problems, and that they might be made acceptably small.},

First, neoclassical phenomena are computed for the LHD and W7-X stellarators using several versions of the drift-kinetic equation, including the commonly used incompressible-E × B-drift approximation and two other variants, corresponding to different effective particle trajectories. It is found that for electric fields below roughly one third of the resonant value, the different formulations give nearly identical results, demonstrating the incompressible E × B-drift approximation is quite accurate in this regime. However, near the electric field resonance, the models yield substantially different results. We also compare results for various collision operators, including the full linearized Fokker-Planck operator. At low collisionality, the radial transport driven by radial gradients is nearly identical for the different operators; while in other cases, it is found to be important that collisions conserve momentum.},

The database contains information from various operational scenarios, amongst them H-mode discharges, and parameters that characterize the rotation, as well as those that describe the general plasma conditions. JET plasmas are predominantly heated by neutral beam injection which is also the main source for the observed toroidal rotation. Dimensionless Mach numbers are introduced to quantify rotation. The scaling of plasma rotation and the Mach numbers in particular has been studied. The thermal and Alfv{\{}{\'{e}}{\}}n Mach numbers were found to scale inversely with q and with the ratio of torque and additional heating power. Although the momentum and energy confinement times were found to be of the same magnitude, the ratio was found to vary. Regression analyses showed a dependence of both the energy and momentum confinement times on plasma rotation. If rotation was included in the scaling model of energy and momentum confinement the quality of the fits substantially improved. Detailed analysis of the core and edge (pedestal) confinement showed that momentum confinement was improved in the core of the plasma compared with the energy confinement. However, the pedestal proved to be less confining for the momentum than for the energy.},

The constant of proportionality is of the order of 10 km{\textperiodcentered}s-1{\textperiodcentered}MA{\textperiodcentered}keV-1. When the intrinsic rotation profile is hollow, i.e., it is countercurrent in the core of the tokamak and cocurrent in the edge, the scaling law presented in this Letter fits the data remarkably well for several tokamaks of vastly different size and heated by different mechanisms.},

At high beta and with large injected neutral beam momentum, the nonresonant field torque slows down the plasma toward the neoclassical "offset" rotation rate. With small injected neutral beam momentum, the toroidal rotation is accelerated toward the offset rotation, with resulting improvement in the global energy confinement time.

abstract = {The enhanced decorrelation of fluctuations by the combined effects of the ExB flow (V(E)) shear, the parallel flow (V(parallel-to)) shear, and the magnetic shear is studied in toroidal geometry. A two-point nonlinear analysis previously utilized in a cylindrical model [Phys. Fluids B 2, 1 (1990)] shows that the reduction of the radial correlation length below its ambient turbulence value (DELTAr0) is characterized by the ratio between the shearing rate omega(s), and the ambient turbulence scattering rate DELTAomega(T). The derived shearing rate is given by omega(s)2 = (DELTAr0)2[(1/DELTAphi2){\{}(partial derivative/partial derivative r)(qV(E)/r){\}}2 +(1/DELTAeta2){\{}(partial derivative/partial derivative r)(V(parallel-to)/qR){\}}2], where DELTAphi and DELTAeta are the correlation angles of the ambient turbulence along the toroidal and parallel directions. This result deviates significantly from the cylindrical result for high magnetic shear or for ballooning-like fluctuations. For suppression of flute-like fluctuations, only the radial shear of qV(E)/r contributes, and the radial shear of V(parallel-to)/qR is irrelevant regardless of the plasma rotation direction.},

The rotation is dominantly co-current with a clear off-axis maximum. There is only a slight difference between a high-field side (HFS) or a low-field side position of this resonance layer: the off-axis maximum in the rotation profile is modestly higher for the HFS position. This is in contrast to the predictions of theories that rely mainly on the effects arising from ICRF-driven fast ions to account for ICRF-induced plasma rotation. The differences due to the direction of the antenna spectrum (co- or counter-) are small. A more central deposition of the ICRF power in L-mode and operation in H-mode both lead to more centrally peaked profiles, both in the co-direction. Strong MHD modes brake the rotation and lead to overall flat rotation profiles.},

@article{DeGrassie2007,
abstract = {In the absence of any auxiliary torque input, the DIII-D plasma consists of nonzero toroidal angular momentum, in other words, it rotates. This effect is commonly observed in tokamaks, being referred to as intrinsic rotation. Measurements of intrinsic rotation profiles have been made in DIII-D [J. Luxon, Nucl. Fusion 42, 614 (2002)] H-mode discharges, with both Ohmic heating (OH) and electron cyclotron heating (ECH) in which there is no auxiliary torque. Recently, the H-mode data set has been extended with the newly configured DIII-D simultaneous co- and counter-directed neutral beam injection (NBI) capability resulting in control of the local torque deposition, where co and counter refer to the direction relative to the toroidal plasma current. Understanding intrinsic rotation is important for projection toward burning plasma performance where any NBI torque will be relatively small. The toroidal velocity is recognizably important regarding issues of stability and confinement. In DIII-D ECH H-modes the rotation profile is hollow, co-directed at large minor radius and depressed, or actually counter-directed, nearer the magnetic axis. This profile varies with the ECH power deposition profile to some extent. In contrast, OH H-modes have a relatively flat co-directed rotation profile. There is a scaling of the DIII-D intrinsic toroidal velocity with W/I-p, as seen in intrinsic rotation in Alcator C-Mod [J. Rice, Nucl. Fusion 39, 1175 (1999)], where W is the total plasma thermal energy and I-p is the magnitude of the toroidal plasma current. This common scaling resulted in a dimensionless similarity experiment between DIII-D and Alcator C-Mod on intrinsic rotation, obtaining a single spatial point match in the toroidal velocity normalized to the ion thermal velocity. The balanced NBI capability in DIII-D is a useful tool to push scaling studies to higher values of the plasma normalized energy, notwithstanding the details of torque deposition for co-NBI versus counter-NBI. There are theories which address intrinsic rotation, both extensions of neoclassical theory and related to turbulent transport. At this time, the comparisons with theory are qualitative.

In this article, a derivation for the expressions of toroidal torque and radial transport in resonant regimes is provided within quasilinear theory in canonical action-angle variables. The proposed approach treats all low-collisional quasilinear resonant NTV regimes including superbanana plateau and drift-orbit resonances in a unified way and allows for magnetic drift in all regimes. It is valid for perturbations on toroidally symmetric flux surfaces of the unperturbed equilibrium without specific assumptions on geometry or aspect ratio. The resulting expressions are shown to match existing analytical results in the large aspect ratio limit. Numerical results from the newly developed code NEO-RT are compared to calculations by the quasilinear version of the code NEO-2 at low collisionalities. The importance of the magnetic shear term in the magnetic drift frequency and a significant effect of the magnetic drift on drift-orbit resonances are demonstrated.},

@article{Matsuoka2015,
abstract = {In evaluating neoclassical transport by radially-local simulations, the magnetic drift tangential to a flux surface is usually ignored in order to keep the phase-space volume conservation. In this paper, effect of the tangential magnetic drift on the local neoclassical transport are investigated. To retain the effect of the tangential magnetic drift in the local treatment of neoclassical transport, a new local formulation for the drift kinetic simulation is developed. The compressibility of the phase-space volume caused by the tangential magnetic drift is regarded as a source term for the drift kinetic equation, which is solved by using a two-weight {\$}\backslashdelta f{\$} Monte Carlo method for non-Hamiltonian system [G.{\~{}}Hu and J.{\~{}}A.{\~{}}Krommes, Phys. Plasmas {\$}\backslashrm \backslashtextbf{\{}1{\}}{\$}, 863 (1994)]. It is demonstrated that the effect of the drift is negligible for the neoclassical transport in tokamaks. In non-axisymmetric systems, however, the tangential magnetic drift substantially changes the dependence of the neoclassical transport on the radial electric field {\$}E{\_}{\{}\backslashrm r{\}}{\$}. The peaked behavior of the neoclassical radial fluxes around {\$}E{\_}{\{}\backslashrm r{\}} = 0{\$} observed in conventional local neoclassical transport simulations is removed by taking the tangential magnetic drift into account.},

@article{Hua2010,
abstract = {Plasma rotation in tokamaks is of special interest for its potential stabilizing effect on micro- and macro-instabilities, leading to increased confinement. In MAST, the torque from neutral beam injection can spin the plasma to a core velocity [?]300 km s[?]1 (Alfven Mach number [?]0.3). Low density plasmas often exhibit a weakly non-monotonic safety factor profile just above unity. Theory predicts that such equilibria are prone to magneto-hydro-dynamic (MHD) instabilities, which was confirmed by recent observations. The appearance of the mode is accompanied by strong damping of core rotation on a timescale much faster than the momentum confinement time.The mode's saturated structure is estimated using the CASTOR code together with soft x-ray measurements, enabling the calculation of the plasma braking by the MHD mode according to neoclassical toroidal viscosity (NTV) theory. The latter exhibits strong similarities with the torque measured experimentally.},

abstract = {A set of external coils (A-coils) capable of producing nonaxisymmetric, predominantly n=1, fields with different toroidal phase and a range of poloidal mode m spectra has been used to determine the threshold amplitude for mode locking over a range of plasma parameters in Alcator C-Mod {\{}[{\}}I.

The threshold perturbations and parametric scalings, expressed in terms of (B-21/B-T), are similar to those observed on larger, lower field devices. The threshold is roughly linear in density, with typical magnitudes of order 10(-4). This result implies that locked modes should not be significantly more problematic for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor {\{}[{\}}I. P. B. Editors, Nucl. Fusion 39, 2286 (1999)] than for existing devices. Coordinated nondimensional identity experiments on the Joint European Torus {\{}[{\}}Fusion Technol. 11, 13 (1987)], DIII-D {\{}[{\}}Fusion Technol. 8, 441 (1985)], and C-Mod, with matching applied mode spectra, have been carried out to determine more definitively the field and size scalings. Locked modes on C-Mod are observed to result in braking of core toroidal rotation, modification of sawtooth activity, and significant reduction in energy and particle confinement, frequently leading to disruptions. Intrinsic error fields inferred from the threshold studies are found to be consistent in amplitude and phase with a comprehensive model of the sources of field errors based on ``as-built{\{}''{\}} coil and bus-work details and coil imperfections inferred from measurements using in situ magnetic diagnostics on dedicated test pulses. Use of the A-coils to largely cancel the 2/1 component of the intrinsic nonaxisymmetric field has led to expansion of the accessible operating space in C-Mod, including operation up to 2 MA plasma current at 8 T.

With the real geometry in JT-60U taken into account, it is found that the NTV is one of the cardinal torque sources especially in the edge region irrespective of the insertion of the ferritic steel tiles (FSTs) that reduce the toroidal field ripple amplitude and is essential to numerically reproduce the measured toroidal rotation profile in the edge. The up–down asymmetric component of the NTV is damped due to the FSTs and the NTV profile correlates with the profile of the radial electric field Er. Predictive simulations for JT-60SA H-mode scenarios are also performed to investigate the effects of the NTV on toroidal rotation. The NTV reversal is observed in the pedestal region where the steep pressure gradient is formed, due to the dependence of the NTV on Er.},

Growth rates calculated by M 3 D- C 1 in the ideal limit are found to agree with those calculated by ideal magnetohydrodynamics codes. The effects of nonuniform density and resistivity profiles are explored, as well as the sensitivity of growth rates to the position of the ideal vacuum-plasma interface. Growth rates of the diverted equilibrium are found to be particularly sensitive to moving this interface inward from the separatrix, but less sensitive to extending the plasma region beyond the separatrix. The resistivity profile within the plasma is found not to affect growth rates significantly; however, growth rates may be greatly reduced by treating the outer region as a resistive plasma instead of an ideal vacuum. Indeed, it is found that for typical scrape-off layer (SOL) temperatures, the resistive SOL model behaves more like an ideal plasma than a vacuum.},

The velocity‐space distribution resulting from trapped, circulating, and transition particle orbits is well represented by a Legendre polynomial expansion in the pitch angle coordinate.

abstract = {The stellarator neoclassical transport caused by particles trapped in local helical wells is calculated in the low‐collisionality regime using a systematic expansion. The behavior of electron transport is found to be the same over a wide range of energies but the behavior of ion transport for low‐energy ions is found to be different than that for high‐energy ions. Furthermore, the electron fluxes do not vary with the change in the radial ambipolar electric field nearly as much as do the ion fluxes. Thus the particle diffusion is controlled by the electrons. A nonradial ambipolar electric field is induced by ion drift. This electric field enhances the transport by about 15{\%}–20{\%}. A convenient graphical method that allows one to determine the magnitude of the radial ambipolar field for machines with different parameters is presented. Numerical examples show that electron energy confinement time is comparable to the ion energy confinement time for all the different size stellarators studied. Although the neoclassical losses are large, it is shown that ignition can be achieved in a reasonably sized stellarator reactor. Finally, fron the standpoint of reactor economics, the confinement scaling law shows that in order to increase n$\tau$, it is better to increase the aspect ratio than the overall dimensions of the reactor.},

@article{Sun2010,
abstract = {Neoclassical toroidal plasma viscosity (NTV) torque induced by non-axisymmetric magnetic perturbation in the collisionless regimes in tokamaks is modelled by solving the bounce-averaged drift kinetic equation numerically. The detailed comparison between the numerical and the analytic solutions of NTV is discussed in this paper. In different asymptotic limits of the collisionless regimes, the numerical solutions are in good agreement with the analytic results. The numerical results are different from the analytic results calculated from the smoothly connected formula in the transit regimes. The pitch angle scattering is especially important in the regime. The final difference between the numerical and the analytic results can be up to a factor of 2 near the transition between the non-resonant and resonant regimes. This reveals the importance of the boundary condition of the pitch angle space. The sign of the electric field is found to be important in the calculation of the NTV torque. It shows that the effect of the resonant particles makes the NTV torque more important for the lower collisionality and lower rotation cases, which are the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor relevant conditions. It also shows that the electron NTV torque is important in the low collisionality case. This numerical method can be applied for modelling the NTV torque in different collisionality regimes and their transitions in tokamaks without additional approximations.},

@article{Satake2011a,
abstract = {A new numerical simulation to evaluate neoclassical toroidal viscosity (NTV) in tokamak configurations with a small perturbation field is developed using the $\delta$f Monte Carlo method. The numerical scheme solves the guiding-centre distribution function in non-axisymmetric plasmas according to the drift-kinetic equation, and evaluates the NTV directly from the pressure anisotropy by utilizing the Fourier spectrum expression of the magnetic field in Boozer coordinates. As a first benchmark, the accuracy of the viscosity calculation is demonstrated in a helical configuration of LHD. The convergence of the calculation and dependence of the viscosity on perturbation field amplitude are also tested in a simple tokamak configuration with model perturbation field, which proves the reliability of the simulation. Next, the basic properties of NTV as dependence of the viscosity on collision frequency and magnetic shear are investigated in a multi-helicity perturbation model field and compared with a bounce-averaged analytic formula. It is found that the clear 1/$\nu$ and superbanana-plateau dependences cannot be seen in the FORTEC-3D simulation, and the toroidicity of the magnetic field makes a toroidal coupling effect, which enhances NTV if the perturbation has (m, n) and (m 1, n) Fourier components simultaneously, where m and n are the poloidal and toroidal numbers of the perturbation field. Local magnetic shear is also found to affect the amplitude of the viscosity. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Calvo2014,
abstract = {Plasma flow is damped in stellarators because they are not intrinsically ambipolar, unlike tokamaks, in which the flux-surface averaged radial electric current vanishes for any value of the radial electric field. Only quasisymmetric stellarators are intrinsically ambipolar, but exact quasisymmetry is impossible to achieve in non-axisymmetric toroidal configurations. By calculating the violation of intrinsic ambipolarity due to deviations from quasisymmetry, one can derive criteria to assess when a stellarator can be considered quasisymmetric in practice, i.e. when the flow damping is weak enough. Let us denote by $\alpha$ a small parameter that controls the size of a perturbation to an exactly quasisymmetric magnetic field. Recently, it has been shown that if the gradient of the perturbation is sufficiently small, the flux-surface averaged radial electric current scales as $\alpha$2 for any value of the collisionality. It was also argued that when the gradient of the perturbation is large, the quadratic scaling is replaced by a more unfavorable one. In this paper, perturbations with large gradients are rigorously treated. In particular, it is proven that for low collisionality a perturbation with large gradient yields, at best, an O(|$\alpha$|) deviation from quasisymmetry. Heuristic estimations in the literature incorrectly predicted an O(|$\alpha$|3/2) deviation. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Tokamak discharges with improved energy confinement properties arising from internal transport barriers (ITBs) have certain attractive features, such as a large bootstrap current fraction, which suggest a potential route to the steady-state mode of operation desirable for fusion power plants. This paper first reviews the present state of theoretical and experimental knowledge regarding the formation and characteristics of ITBs in tokamaks. Specifically, the current status of theoretical modelling of ITBs is presented; then, an international ITB database based on experimental information extracted from some nine tokamaks is described and used to draw some general conclusions concerning the necessary conditions for ITBs to appear, comparing these with the theoretical models. The experimental situation regarding the steady-state, or at least quasi-steady-state, operation of tokamaks is reviewed and finally the issues and prospects for achieving such operational modes in ITER are discussed. More detailed information on the characteristics of ITBs in some 13 tokamaks (as well as helical devices) appears in the appendix.},

abstract = {The method of Hammett and Perkins [Phys. Rev. Lett. 64, 3019 (1990)] to model Landau damping has been recently applied to the moments of the gyrokinetic equation with curvature drift by Waltz, Dominguez, and Hammett [Phys. Fluids B 4, 3138 (1992)]. The higher moments are truncated in terms of the lower moments (density, parallel velocity, and parallel and perpendicular pressure) by modeling the deviation from a perturbed Maxwellian to fit the kinetic response function at all values of the kinetic parameters: k$\backslash$$\backslash$v(th)/omega, b = (k perpendicular-to rho)2/2, and omega(D)/omega. Here the resulting gyro-Landau fluid equations are applied to the simulation of ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode turbulence in toroidal geometry using a novel three-dimensional (3-D) nonlinear ballooning mode representation. The representation is a Fourier transform of a field line following basis (k(y)',k(x)',z') with periodicity in toroidal and poloidal angles. Particular emphasis is given to the role of nonlinearly generated n = 0 (k(y)' = 0, k(x)' not-equal 0) ''radial modes'' in stabilizing the transport from the finite-n ITG ballooning modes. Detailing the parametric dependence of toroidal ITG turbulence is a key result.},
