  abstract={Two approaches are examined for stabilization of the resistive wall mode (RWM) of toroidal mode number n = 1 in an advanced ITER scenario. Active feedback control, with the present coil design and poloidal sensors placed just inside the inner wall, can be very efficient in stabilizing the RWM. Within the voltage limit of the present design for the feedback coils and conservative constraints on performance, the plasma pressure can be increased up to at least 70% between the no-wall and ideal-wall beta limits. Stabilization of the RWM by toroidal plasma rotation depends on the rotation profile as well as on the model for ion Landau damping. Feedback control of rotating plasmas for the advanced scenario is considered. The effect of the blanket is also studied using a simplified model.}

abstract = {By using a fully three dimensional magnetic field orbit-following Monte-Carlo code, the energetic ion confinement was investigated for the current conceptual design of the ferromagnetic components in ITER which will be employed for reducing the toroidal magnetic field (TF) ripple. The ferromagnetic insert is effective in the reference standard scenario with Q = 10 (Scenario No. 2) and steady state scenario with Q = 5 (Scenario No. 4) to improve the energetic ion confinement. Over-compensation appears at half of the full toroidal magnetic field and its effect becomes stronger when the quantity of the ferromagnetic insert is increased in order to more reduce the TF ripple at the full toroidal magnetic field. Though the current design is acceptable, whether to increase the ferromagnetic insert to achieve lower TF ripple amplitude at the full field operation depends on how prospected are possibilities of lower field operations. Planned test blanket modules do not induce large loss ({\textless}1{\%}) at the full field in Scenario No. 4. At the half field, however, the loss reaches ???10{\%} for the alpha particles due to localized large TF ripple. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Up to six different concepts for tritium breeding blanket systems, referred to as Test Blanket Systems (TBS), will be tested in three equatorial ports of ITER. Successful TBS experiments in ITER represent an essential step on the path to DEMO for all the ITER Members' fusion development plans. The ITER Members are in charge of the design, manufacturing and delivery of the TBSs to the ITER site. The IO has responsibility for preparing the necessary interfaces required for the installation of the TBSs. Moreover, the TBM Program has to be fully integrated in the ITER Research Plan and its testing objectives have to be synchronized with the planned ITER operations. The paper addresses the major implementation steps of the TBM Program in ITER, including the organizational aspects, its integration into the ITER Research Plan and the Operational Plan, the licensing procedure and also gives a short overview of the TBS/ITER interfaces issues. ?? 2010 V.A.

@article{Schaffer2011,
abstract = {Experiments at DIII-D investigated the effects of magnetic error fields similar to those expected from proposed ITER test blanket modules (TBMs) containing ferromagnetic material. Studied were effects on: plasma rotation and locking, confinement, L–H transition, the H-mode pedestal, edge localized modes (ELMs) and ELM suppression by resonant magnetic perturbations, energetic particle losses, and more. The experiments used a purpose-built three-coil mock-up of two magnetized ITER TBMs in one ITER equatorial port. The largest effect was a reduction in plasma toroidal rotation velocity v across the entire radial profile by as much as $\Delta$v/v {\~{}} 60{\%} via non-resonant braking. Changes to global $\Delta$n/n, $\Delta$$\beta$/$\beta$ and $\Delta$H98/H98 were {\~{}}3 times smaller. These effects are stronger at higher $\beta$. Other effects were smaller. The TBM field increased sensitivity to locking by an applied known n = 1 test field in both L- and H-mode plasmas. Locked mode tolerance was completely restored in L-mode by re-adjusting the DIII-D n = 1 error field compensation system. Numerical modelling by IPEC reproduces the rotation braking and locking semi-quantitatively, and identifies plasma amplification of a few n = 1 Fourier harmonics as the main cause of braking. IPEC predicts that TBM braking in H-mode may be reduced by n = 1 control. Although extrapolation from DIII-D to ITER is still an open issue, these experiments suggest that a TBM-like error field will produce only a few potentially troublesome problems, and that they might be made acceptably small.},

The model is able to accurately reproduce the change in sign of core toroidal rotation, using experimental density and temperature profiles from shots with rotation reversals as inputs and no free parameters fit to experimental data.},

First, neoclassical phenomena are computed for the LHD and W7-X stellarators using several versions of the drift-kinetic equation, including the commonly used incompressible-E × B-drift approximation and two other variants, corresponding to different effective particle trajectories. It is found that for electric fields below roughly one third of the resonant value, the different formulations give nearly identical results, demonstrating the incompressible E × B-drift approximation is quite accurate in this regime. However, near the electric field resonance, the models yield substantially different results. We also compare results for various collision operators, including the full linearized Fokker-Planck operator. At low collisionality, the radial transport driven by radial gradients is nearly identical for the different operators; while in other cases, it is found to be important that collisions conserve momentum.},

The database contains information from various operational scenarios, amongst them H-mode discharges, and parameters that characterize the rotation, as well as those that describe the general plasma conditions. JET plasmas are predominantly heated by neutral beam injection which is also the main source for the observed toroidal rotation. Dimensionless Mach numbers are introduced to quantify rotation. The scaling of plasma rotation and the Mach numbers in particular has been studied. The thermal and Alfv{\{}{\'{e}}{\}}n Mach numbers were found to scale inversely with q and with the ratio of torque and additional heating power. Although the momentum and energy confinement times were found to be of the same magnitude, the ratio was found to vary. Regression analyses showed a dependence of both the energy and momentum confinement times on plasma rotation. If rotation was included in the scaling model of energy and momentum confinement the quality of the fits substantially improved. Detailed analysis of the core and edge (pedestal) confinement showed that momentum confinement was improved in the core of the plasma compared with the energy confinement. However, the pedestal proved to be less confining for the momentum than for the energy.},

The constant of proportionality is of the order of 10 km{\textperiodcentered}s-1{\textperiodcentered}MA{\textperiodcentered}keV-1. When the intrinsic rotation profile is hollow, i.e., it is countercurrent in the core of the tokamak and cocurrent in the edge, the scaling law presented in this Letter fits the data remarkably well for several tokamaks of vastly different size and heated by different mechanisms.},

At high beta and with large injected neutral beam momentum, the nonresonant field torque slows down the plasma toward the neoclassical "offset" rotation rate. With small injected neutral beam momentum, the toroidal rotation is accelerated toward the offset rotation, with resulting improvement in the global energy confinement time. The observed magnitude, direction, and radial profile of the offset rotation are consistent with neoclassical theory predictions.},

abstract = {The enhanced decorrelation of fluctuations by the combined effects of the ExB flow (V(E)) shear, the parallel flow (V(parallel-to)) shear, and the magnetic shear is studied in toroidal geometry. A two-point nonlinear analysis previously utilized in a cylindrical model [Phys. Fluids B 2, 1 (1990)] shows that the reduction of the radial correlation length below its ambient turbulence value (DELTAr0) is characterized by the ratio between the shearing rate omega(s), and the ambient turbulence scattering rate DELTAomega(T). The derived shearing rate is given by omega(s)2 = (DELTAr0)2[(1/DELTAphi2){\{}(partial derivative/partial derivative r)(qV(E)/r){\}}2 +(1/DELTAeta2){\{}(partial derivative/partial derivative r)(V(parallel-to)/qR){\}}2], where DELTAphi and DELTAeta are the correlation angles of the ambient turbulence along the toroidal and parallel directions. This result deviates significantly from the cylindrical result for high magnetic shear or for ballooning-like fluctuations. For suppression of flute-like fluctuations, only the radial shear of qV(E)/r contributes, and the radial shear of V(parallel-to)/qR is irrelevant regardless of the plasma rotation direction.},

abstract = {Plasmas heated by ICRF only in the JET tokamak show distinct structures in the toroidal rotation profile, with regions where domega/dr {\textgreater} 0 when the minority cyclotron resonance layer is far off-axis. The rotation is dominantly co-current with a clear off-axis maximum. There is only a slight difference between a high-field side (HFS) or a low-field side position of this resonance layer: the off-axis maximum in the rotation profile is modestly higher for the HFS position. This is in contrast to the predictions of theories that rely mainly on the effects arising from ICRF-driven fast ions to account for ICRF-induced plasma rotation. The differences due to the direction of the antenna spectrum (co- or counter-) are small. A more central deposition of the ICRF power in L-mode and operation in H-mode both lead to more centrally peaked profiles, both in the co-direction. Strong MHD modes brake the rotation and lead to overall flat rotation profiles.},

@article{DeGrassie2007,
abstract = {In the absence of any auxiliary torque input, the DIII-D plasma consists of nonzero toroidal angular momentum, in other words, it rotates. This effect is commonly observed in tokamaks, being referred to as intrinsic rotation. Measurements of intrinsic rotation profiles have been made in DIII-D [J. Luxon, Nucl. Fusion 42, 614 (2002)] H-mode discharges, with both Ohmic heating (OH) and electron cyclotron heating (ECH) in which there is no auxiliary torque. Recently, the H-mode data set has been extended with the newly configured DIII-D simultaneous co- and counter-directed neutral beam injection (NBI) capability resulting in control of the local torque deposition, where co and counter refer to the direction relative to the toroidal plasma current. Understanding intrinsic rotation is important for projection toward burning plasma performance where any NBI torque will be relatively small. The toroidal velocity is recognizably important regarding issues of stability and confinement. In DIII-D ECH H-modes the rotation profile is hollow, co-directed at large minor radius and depressed, or actually counter-directed, nearer the magnetic axis. This profile varies with the ECH power deposition profile to some extent. In contrast, OH H-modes have a relatively flat co-directed rotation profile. There is a scaling of the DIII-D intrinsic toroidal velocity with W/I-p, as seen in intrinsic rotation in Alcator C-Mod [J. Rice, Nucl. Fusion 39, 1175 (1999)], where W is the total plasma thermal energy and I-p is the magnitude of the toroidal plasma current. This common scaling resulted in a dimensionless similarity experiment between DIII-D and Alcator C-Mod on intrinsic rotation, obtaining a single spatial point match in the toroidal velocity normalized to the ion thermal velocity. The balanced NBI capability in DIII-D is a useful tool to push scaling studies to higher values of the plasma normalized energy, notwithstanding the details of torque deposition for co-NBI versus counter-NBI. There are theories which address intrinsic rotation, both extensions of neoclassical theory and related to turbulent transport. At this time, the comparisons with theory are qualitative.

In this article, a derivation for the expressions of toroidal torque and radial transport in resonant regimes is provided within quasilinear theory in canonical action-angle variables. The proposed approach treats all low-collisional quasilinear resonant NTV regimes including superbanana plateau and drift-orbit resonances in a unified way and allows for magnetic drift in all regimes. It is valid for perturbations on toroidally symmetric flux surfaces of the unperturbed equilibrium without specific assumptions on geometry or aspect ratio. The resulting expressions are shown to match existing analytical results in the large aspect ratio limit. Numerical results from the newly developed code NEO-RT are compared to calculations by the quasilinear version of the code NEO-2 at low collisionalities. The importance of the magnetic shear term in the magnetic drift frequency and a significant effect of the magnetic drift on drift-orbit resonances are demonstrated.},
